This project is based on the original [CloudComparer](https://github.com/ilyas-it83/CloudComparer) repository created by [Ilyas](https://github.com/ilyas-it83).  
It presents a comparison chart of cloud services offered by major public cloud vendors around the world.

### What this project offers

- A mapping of services across public cloud providers including **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, **Microsoft Azure**, **Google Cloud**, **IBM Cloud**, **Oracle Cloud**, **Alibaba Cloud**, and **Huawei Cloud**
- A quick-reference manual to identify equivalent services between providers.
- This is NOT a comparison chart/material between the cloud providers.
- “None” mentioned against certain services is based on unavailability of certain direct mapping services between cloud providers.
- For any queries or issues, please raise an issue here.
- Listing doesn't include third party services offered through cloud market places.

### Updates in this fork

- **Huawei Cloud services** have been reviewed and updated
- This version may change visual layout and functionality.

### Credits

- Original concept and structure by [Ilyas](https://github.com/ilyas-it83)
- This fork by [kxrojas](https://github.com/kxrojas) builds on top of that work
